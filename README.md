# Relationship Dynamics and Protocols
# THIS IS NOT A PROGRAM/APPLICATION!!!!
# DESCRIPTION: This IS a personal project consisting of ad hoc visuals. The tables, charts, graphs and decision trees address blended family dynamics and protocols with respect to a romatic partnership where one party has pre-existing children and begins dating someone who is childless. Graphics were incorporated into a written proposal and used to convey potential interactions and financial responsibilities, in different scenarios, through progressive stages of the relationship (i.e., dating, engagement, marriage).
